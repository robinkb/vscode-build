= Build scripts for Visual Studio Code OSS
:url-jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
:url-podman: https://podman.io/

Container-based build scripts to compile Visual Studio Code into an RPM package.

== Quick Start

Make sure that you have `make`, `jq`, and `podman` installed.

----
$ git clone https://github.com/robinkb/vscode-build
$ cd vscode-build
$ make
----

The RPM package is placed under `target/`.

== Dependencies

The scripts use {url-podman}[Podman] to run the builds in a container.
Podman is an excellent alternative to Docker that does not require root permissions to create containers.

{url-jq}[jq] is used to patch the `product.json` file included with Visual Studio Code OSS.
The OSS version is missing the required properties to enable the extension store.
Some of the properties like the executable name are also suffixed with `-oss`, which the patch removes.

== Configuration

The Makefile defines a number of variables, like the version of Visual Studio Code to compile.
